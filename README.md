This repo was created to follow along with [this blog post](https://ibis-project.org/posts/ibis-overturemaps/). It showcases the power of using Ibis, DuckDB, GeoParquet, Overture Maps, and lonboard for geospatial data processing and visualization. It also provided an opportunity for me to explore Astral's [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package for Python package management.
